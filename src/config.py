Keeping up with your shift schedule is *hard*, and trying to find times to
have meetings or spend time with friends can be even harder.

Thinking of planning a meeting or get together? Pick a range of dates, a 
target time window, and ResiDoodle will do the rest! It automatically pulls
the ShiftAdmin schedule and does its best to guess when people are off service.

Try it below! If you have any questions, you can reach out to Max or leave 
feedback [here](https://forms.gle/LzHDs6e6giXcAT8M8).
